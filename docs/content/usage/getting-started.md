If you haven't deployed the Monkey Island yet, please [refer to our setup documentation](/setup)

## Using the Infection Monkey

After deploying the Monkey Island in your environment, navigate to `https://<server-ip>:5000`. 

### First-time login

On your first login, you'll be asked to set up a username and password for the Monkey Island server. [See this page for more details](../../setup/accounts-and-security).

### Run the Monkey

To get the Infection Monkey running as fast as possible, click **Run Monkey**. Optionally, you can configure the Monkey before you continue by clicking **Configuration** (see [how to configure the monkey](../configuration)).

To run the monkey, select one of the following options:

![Run Page](/images/usage/getting-started/run_page_with_arrows.jpg "Run Page")

1. Click **Run on C&C Server** to run the Infection Monkey on the Monkey Island server. This simulates an attacker trying to propagate through local network from Monkey Island machine.
2. Click **Run on machine of your choice** to download and execute the Infection Monkey on a machine of your choice. Then follow the instructions and execute the generated command on the machine of your choice. This simulates an attacker who has breached one of your servers. The Monkey will map all accessible machines and their open services and try to steal credentials and use its exploits to propagate.

At first, the infection map will look like this:

![Start of Monkey execution](/images/usage/getting-started/run_island.JPG "Start of Monkey execution")

Within a few minutes, the Infection Monkey should be able to find and attack accessible machines.

![Middle of Monkey execution](/images/usage/getting-started/single_exploitation.JPG "Middle of Monkey execution")

As the Infection Monkey continues, the map should be filled with accessible and ‚Äúhacked‚Äù machines. Once all the Infection Monkeys have finished propagating, click **Reports** to see the reports. See [Infection Monkey Reports](../reports) for more info.

![End of Monkey execution](/images/usage/getting-started/exploitation_tunneling_arrow.jpg "End of Monkey execution")

Congratulations, you finished first successful execution of the Infection Monkey! üéâ To thoroughly test your network, you can run the Infection Monkey from different starting locations using different configurations.
